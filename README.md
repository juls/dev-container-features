# Dev Container Features

This repo is my place for my custom dev container features - see [containers.dev/features](https://containers.dev/features) for more.

I make no guarantee that features here won't break with updates etc, but I use [stuartleeks/dev-container-features-playground](https://github.com/stuartleeks/dev-container-features-playground) for experimenting with features.



If you want to create your own features, see <https://github.com/devcontainers/feature-template>
